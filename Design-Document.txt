This system is domain specific for searching through emails.
The major datastructures used this project are :
1:	unordered_map (hash table) of lists (doubly linked lists(DLLS)) for indexing 
2:	DLL contains struct Node which contains the name i.e path of email files and term frequency of the token ;

DLLs were used instead of vectors as the vector maxtrix is highly sparsed 


Architecture of system:
This is a rank retrival model which used tf-idf 
using LTN.NNN weighting scheme as the queries for emails are short.
